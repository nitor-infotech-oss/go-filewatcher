# go-filewatcher

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

# Objective

- Develop a daemon based technology solution that will given a list of source watch directories and REGEX patterns for filenames.  Move files to a corresponding list of target directories with decompression, if the source file is compressed.
- This solution would in addition send alerts via slack to inform a group of recipients that a move event was triggered and the details of the event.  
- The list of source, target directories and rules should be configurable and stored in json file.

# Solution Approach
AWS Lambda is a serverless offering by AWS cloud and identified as s best fit for File Watcher components.
Below are the important components of the solution â€“
- This lambda function is the fileWatcher program which can be invoked using the api endpoint from external program.
- It reads the configurations from json file and perform actions on the file like unzip, move it to target bucket by creating the require directory structure on the target bucket.
- Logs the execution of the process in the and send an alert with execution details to Slack

### Dependencies

GoLang packages dependencies:
* [aws-sdk-go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go)
* [golang-x](https://golang.org/x/sync)
